- Explored audio data, noting vocal nuances, numbers 1-20, and coughing revealed insights in linguistic patterns.
- Trained CNN with spectrogram data, added linear classifier for COVID prediction, and fine-tuned through varied hyperparameters for 85.7% accuracy on a combined test and validation data.

**Software Engineer Intern @ Empyra**
- Utilized Microsoft SQL Server to analyze and combine two databases, skillfully creating an optimized database prototype by eliminating redundant entities and fields.
- Spearheaded the development of recommendation systems, enhancing the client experience by implementing personalized job, course, and training program recommendations.
- Evaluated various tech stacks for the back end of the new system, considering system architecture and comparing technologies, leading to informed and strategic decisions.

## Projects

**Deconstructing Sexual Stereotypes in Large Language Models**   
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00101.pdf)

- Generated gender-neutral text from 700k WikiBio dataset using rule-based methods and regular expressions.
- Generated prompts by appending sexual identity trigger words to contextualize LLM responses for analysis.
- Employed SHAP analysis to detect and mitigate unconscious bias in LLM outputs formulating text-to-text style transfer with chain-of-thought prompting reducing regard difference from 0.15 to 0.06.

**ASL to Text Translation as an Assistive Technology**
- Devised an effective on-device efficient sign-language translation system on Raspberry Pi.
- Evaluated efficiency-accuracy tradeoff using Resnet models with techniques such as quantization and pruning.

**Detecting Onsets Using EEG Signals**
- Implemented a novel approach in PyTorch utilizing deep learning techniques to predict onsets of audios obtained from a publicly available dataset containing EEG signals of 20 participants listening to 10 songs.
- Improved upon the existing baseline metrics with a recall of 0.9245 from 0.4, F1 score of 0.6786 from 0.54, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.605 from 0.54.

**Cartoonization of Real-World Images**
- Trained a GAN in PyTorch to generate cartoonized versions of real world images.
- Investigated the impact of different loss terms on the generated cartoon output to find the best tradeoff between edge sharpness and color fill.

**Question Answering System**
- Implemented BERT-based transformer models from HuggingFace using data from Wikipedia articles.
- Employed SpaCy for tokenization, NER, and coreference resolution, and then containerized using Docker.

**Movie Recommendation System**
- Developed ML-based system supporting 1 million users providing recommendations within 500 ms for 40% of user requests.
- Built deployment server in Flask to host containerized models using Docker and listen to Kafka stream requests.

**Deep Learning Based Face Mask Detection and Crowd Counting**   
[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9417826)
